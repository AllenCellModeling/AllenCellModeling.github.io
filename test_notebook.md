# Publishing a Jupyter-notebook

We want to support most things we will do in a data story. Like display some math:

$$e^{i \pi}+1=0$$

Or perhaps some code:


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

And even graphs generated by such code:


```python
x = np.linspace(0,4*np.pi,500)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x));
```
